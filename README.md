<h1 align="center">Hi! I'm Emma Bea Mitchell 🐝 (<em>she/her</em>)</h1>

I'm currently a Master's student in [Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science/academics-meds-program) at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara. I am following my passion for environmental justice and environmental policy by learning to utilize the power of computer programming to communicate and help repair the harmful impacts of dangerous environmental decisions on people and the environment. Learn more about my professional interests [on my blog](emmabeamitchell.github.io). I love to paddleboard, kayak, and swim in the summer months, and cozy up at home with a good book the rest of the year.

It has red hair with bangs and is wearing crossbody bag, a pair of overalls, a beret, and black converse. She holds a magnifying glass in an outstretched tentacle. She looks like a cute Parisian Nancy Drew">
